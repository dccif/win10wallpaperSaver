# Introduction

One of the features of Windows 10 i like, is the chance to have dynamic wallpapers when locking the screen.
But, ouch! I liked that one so much...It's unlikely that Windows will show me that again!
This time I was lucky, I found the image on the web...but...next time?
No problem! There's **Win10WallpaperSaver** now!

# Requirements

The repo contains 2 versions of the script.
I made the original version to save only images with 1920x1080 resolution, because Windows will save full images and clipped images (with resolution 1080x1920).
That version requires a software called "Image Magick" (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows), but if you want to check manually or simply use the script without dependencies theres a "noDeps" version for you!

# Usage

Simply double click the BAT file.
A "Assets" folder will be created on your desktop!
